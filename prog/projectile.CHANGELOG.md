  present you'll be prompted for the project whose cache to
  invalidate.
* New command `projectile-find-dir` works similar to
  `projectile-find-file` - displays the project's dirs and opens them

* Rebound `projectile-dired` to <kbd>C-c p D</kbd>
* Reworked `projectile-compile-project` and `projectile-test-project`
  to be smarter, more configurable and closer in behavior to the stock
